### NOTE: as of 25/01/2021, cdn.dlcordapp.com has exceeded the hosting costs I am willing to pay for and maintain. I am working on other projects and not software dev anymore, and while I love this site, I can't maintain it and continue paying out of pocket. Thank you to everyone who shared a link or contributed, we had a good run

A web app that embeds actual images in Discord but then redirects to Rickroll for in browser requests. 

Will probably add functionality to also select multiple different redirects, for example to Sax Guy, Reddit's infamous *Thunder Cross Split Attack*, and Steamed Hams.
